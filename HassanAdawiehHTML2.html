        <h3><em>Piano</em></h3>
        <p><b>piano</b>, or pianoforte, Keyboard instrument with wire strings that sound when
            struck by hammers operated
            by
            a keyboard. It was invented in Florence by Bartolomeo Cristofori before 1720, with the particular aim of
            permitting
            note-to-note dynamic variation (lacking in the harpsichord). It differs from the older clavichord in that
            its hammers
            (rather than tangents) are thrown at the strings and bounce back, permitting the struck string to vibrate
            loudly. A
            cast-iron frame is needed to withstand the strings’ tremendous tension. Pianos have taken various shapes.
            The original
            harpsichord (or wing) shape has survived in the modern grand piano; the less-expensive square (actually
            rectangular)
            piano, standard in the early 19th century, was replaced by the upright piano, in which the strings are
            vertical. For at
            least 150 years the piano was the most important instrument in Western music. </p>

        <h3>Violin</h3>
        <p>
            No headings were found on this page.
            One of the challenges when learning how to play the <u>violin</u> is learning how to hold it first. Unlike
            the piano, where you sit down and adjust your sitting position; the violin requires a set of rules you need
            to follow to find the optimal playing position.

            You also add to your consideration the different physique of each student learning how to hold the
            instrument.

            If you don’t own a <u>violin</u> yet and plan to buy one, please check our ultimate guide for beginners. Our
            guide will tell you all the necessary things you need to know when you want to buy your violin.</p>
